									Motivation:
								</h2>
								<p>
									Interaction bridges from human to machine, human to information and human to human are what I am building and let's call them digital interfaces!
								</p>
								<p>
									I believe interfaces should be powered by new technologies and they should be capable of learning through the interaction history data to encourage positive interactions and lower the cost and boundaries.
								</p>
								<p>
									I spend most of my college years on building interfaces between human and computer/robots.
									I have experimented on EEG, EMG technologies combined with voice control and build a interface that people who has no limb control can still have a good control.
									This interface are adapted to control eletrical-wheelchairs, vechecla-robot-base and internet browsing experience.

									I had the amazing opportunity to participate in project like DARPA Humanoid Robot Project and NASA ROBO Ops.
								</p>

								<p>
									After graduation, I started to work in a User Experience Development at Fidelity. , Working there taught me a lot on how to build interface people would love to interact with through user researches and testings pienrrred.
									and I start to become interested in building new interface can encourage human to interaction with information.
									<br>
									I developed an opinion sharing interface in audio format with the publishers' geo location linked on a world map. The goal was to create a different sharing experience which was geo-location based and audio formated.
									With opinions posted on geo-location based world map, it's amazingly to see people start to post their different opinion based on their culture.
								</p>

								<p>
									Mixed reality control and interaction interfaces are my current focus.
									Audio interfaces in 3D spacial sounds I created a discovery-oriented language learning interface which simulate the natural learning experience.
									I build real-time in-person social interaction to help smooth the interaction between strangers by showing their profile information rendered next to their body following them in real time.
									This reduced the time cost on introduction and social ice-break so people can start a meanful conversition without having to go through the somewhat awkward process of the inital greeting stage.
									By just seeing their interest directly, tt also effectively encouraged people to talk to the people who share these common interests.

									I believe this type of interfaces will dramaticly lower the cost between in-person communication in groups which people have very less knoweldge of each other but wish to have desired and meanful conversition.

									I was fortunate enough to collaborate on project, Mindful Wearable, born from MIT Media Lab in Fluid Interface group, which creates mixed reality intervention on human behaviors.
								</p>

								<p>
									Interface should have memories of themselves. The memory history should be an input factor feedback to the interfaces.
									I experimented on integrating memories to control the interface on the wheelchair project. The control histories are a parallel inputs just as the direct control input.
									This effectively removed a lot of the control noises for more accurate outcome.
